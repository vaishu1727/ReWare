# ReWare
ReWare is a full-stack web application designed to promote sustainable living by simplifying the process of donating and redistributing clothes. The platform bridges the gap between donors who want to give away wearable clothes and receivers such as NGOs, ashrams, and individuals in need.

Built with modern web technologies, ReWare provides an intuitive interface for donors to upload clothing details and for registered receivers to browse and request donations based on categories, sizes, and locations. The system ensures transparency, traceability, and ease of use to foster a culture of reuse and reduce textile waste.
